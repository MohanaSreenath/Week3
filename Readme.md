## Overview
Week 3 introduces you to essential data structures—such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps—and key algorithms for sorting and searching. You will also learn how to analyze the runtime performance of algorithms. This knowledge is crucial for building efficient and scalable Java applications.

## Topics Covered
Day 1: Linked Lists

Understanding singly and doubly linked lists

Implementing linked lists in Java

Real-world examples: Inventory management, Library systems, Movie ticketing, Task management, Undo functionality

Day 2: Stack, Queue, and HashMap

Stack and queue fundamentals and their Java implementations

Applications: Circular tour, sliding window problems, recursion with stacks, queue using stacks, stock span problem

Introduction to hash maps and their use cases

Day 3: Sorting Algorithms

Implementing and comparing sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Counting sort

Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm

Day 4: Searching Algorithms

Linear and binary search methods

Advanced search problems: Finding the first negative number, searching for words in sentences

Day 5: Algorithm Runtime Analysis

Basics of algorithm complexity (Big O notation)

Analyzing time and space complexity of sorting and searching algorithms

Practical performance comparison: Fibonacci calculation, file comparison, string concatenation performance

## Prerequisites
Completion of Week 2 (Object-Oriented Programming concepts)

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

Familiarity with basic Java syntax, classes, and methods

How to Use This Repository
Each day's folder contains Java source files for the relevant data structure or algorithm.

Review, run, and experiment with the code to understand how each data structure and algorithm works.

Try modifying the examples or implementing additional features to reinforce your learning.
